## Design

### Colour Scheme

I began using the pallete below as inspiration for the colour scheme:

![Colour Scheme for Deaf Cats](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/1027514)

I then experimented with different tones and shades of these colours using WebAIM's color contrast checker:
![Contrast checker][https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/]


The the contrast ratio for the chosen colors for text and header & footer background elements passes the contrast checker for all colors. 

### Typography

I used Google Fonts to import the following fonts for use in the site:

##### Logo 
![Monoton](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Monoton?query=monoton) 
I chose this as it has smooth curves and makes a unique logo style. 
![sample](documentation/fonts/monotonsample.png)

##### Headings 
![Ubuntu](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu?preview.text=Deaf%20Cats&preview.text_type=custom&query=ubun) 
The font is easy to read, has good speacing between letters and continues the curves of the logo. 
![sample](documentation/fonts/ubuntusample.png)

##### Paragraphs 
![Cabin Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cabin+Condensed?preview.text=Deaf%20Cats&preview.text_type=custom&query=cabin+con)
I felt this complimented the headings font well and is a sans-serif which improves legability. 
![sample](documentation/fonts/cabincondensedsample.png)

##### Icons 
![Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons)
Icons are a good way to add accessability features to a website 


### Imagery

Favicon generated using [Favicon generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) ![Favicon](/assets/images/dc-favicon.ico)

As the site is for fans of the band I have chosen imsges of a group of people from a stockfile website. I have complimented these with musical themed images.Please view the media section for more information on where each image was sourced.


### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile and desktop using Balsamiq.

#### __Home Page__

### Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

* Create a ticket booking system/allow users to boy tickets on the website.
* Create an online shop selling merchandise.
* Add a sign up link for a mailing list.
* Add a blog documenting tour journey.
* Add a live instagram or twitter feed.
* Add an audio player with user controls to the gallery page.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes and titles for images and video on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Adding "current" to navigation for screen reader to inform of page being accessed.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

### Code Used


All instances of Tutor support and fixes found online are documented as comments in the code.

##### Gallery Page

[Responsive Gallery Tutorial](https://blog.logrocket.com/responsive-image-gallery-css-flexbox/)
[Responsive Gallery Source Code](https://codesandbox.io/s/delicate-wave-sts6l7?file=/index.html:313-2227)
To create the gallery page I followed the above tutorial to make the responsive gallery page. Doing this helped me to learn more about how flexbox works. After this I went to make the history page.

##### History Page

I used the tutorial playlist above to make a flexbox grid layout that becomes a stack for a smaller resolution.

##### Live Page
